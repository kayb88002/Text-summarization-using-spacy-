ICMR-NICED admitted that there was problem in the kits and said that they are addressing the issue.[64] While Rajasthan stopped using rapid testing kits as they were giving low accuracy of 5.4% in compared to expected 90% accuracy.[65] Later, ICMR advised all states to stop using rapid testing kits for next two days until their on-ground teams validates these kits.[66] Rapid antibody test kits were put on hold till further notice. The Chinese manufactures of the rapid testing kits said that the testing kits were approved by ICMR and the problem is not with the kits but with the way they were being used.

They are also designing low-cost or mobile medical equipment.[86][87][88][89] The focus was to increase the production of low-cost, compact and portable ventilators that could cater to multiple patients at a time. This led to the creation of some of the world's smallest and cheapest ventilators.[90] The government aims to double the current capacity of ventilators by June 2020 with the assistance from PSUs.

      "NEW DELHI: Led by declining average daily new cases of Covid-19 and rising recoveries, the total number of active cases in the country has slumped to less than 3 lakh after over five-and-a-half months, the government said on Tuesday underlining the progress in combating the pandemic. Average daily deaths due to Covid-19 have declined week-on-week since Nov18-24 from 528 deaths to 343 in the December 16-22 week. Average daily new cases have also declined significantly week on week during last 7 weeks from over 46,301 cases in the Nov 4-10 week to 24,135 during Dec 16-22“It is a big achievement and credit goes to every frontline worker, administration and officials who are engaged in coronavirus containment related work. Currently, the active cases are less than 3 per cent of overall cases. The daily new cases are less than 20,000 after 173 days. More than 16.3 crore tests have been conducted so far,” health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said.The declining trend in fresh cases as well as deaths in India is encouraging as various countries are still witnessing a significantly high burden of the infection and fatality. Large number of new Covid-19 cases are being reported daily from countries like the US, Brazil , UK, Russia and Germany.“From mid-September, India is witnessing a sustained and continuous decline in new cases. The cases per million population for the world is 9,697, India's cases per million population stand at 7,300, Russia's 19,719, UK's 30,052 and cases per million population in US stand at 52,915,” Bhushan said.Bhushan said that the deaths per million population in India is 106 while the world's stand at 216. Health ministry data shows 57% of the new cases in the last 24 hours were reported from six states including Kerala, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh,Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh, whereas 61% of deaths in the last 24 hours were in Maharashtra, West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Chhattisgarh and UP.\n",

      "By doing so, India became the fifth country to successfully obtain a pure sample of the virus after China, Japan, Thailand and the US.[37] The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said that isolation of the virus will help towards expediting the development of drugs, vaccines and rapid diagnostic kits in the country.[38] NIV has shared two SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences with GISAID.[39] On 16 April, China sent 650,000 testing kits to India[40] but their use was discontinued in view of a very low accuracy (of just 5.4%).[41] In May, National Institute of Virology introduced another antibody test kit ELISA for rapid testing, capable of processing 90 samples in a single run of 2.5 hours.[42]\n",

      "65 laboratories of the Department of Health Research and the Indian Council of Medical Research (DHR-ICMR) have started testing random samples of people who exhibit flu-like symptoms and samples from patients without any travel history or contact with infected persons.[71][72] As of 18 March, no evidence of community transmission was found after results of 500 random samples tested negative.[73] Between 15 February and 2 April, 5,911 SARI (Severe Acute Respiratory Illnesses) patients were tested throughout the country of which, 104 tested positive (1.8%) in 20 states and union territories.\n",
